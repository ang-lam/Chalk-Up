# Sinatra Project - Chalk Up

Phase 2 Flatiron project.


Chalk Up is a simple website to keep track of your weightlifting progress. You no longer need to carry a notebook and pen with you to the gym to track the heavy weights you're lifting. With Chalk Up, you can track the date of the workout, exercise names and the weight you're performing your reps. This is an MVC (models, views, controllers) Sinatra application using ActiveRecord and CRUD


## Installation

Execute:

    bundle install

Start the application in terminal by system command: `shotgun`

Go to `http://localhost:9393/` in your browser to view the application.

If you're a new user, click on the link below the login form to navigate to the signup page. After creating your account, you can start logging your workouts!
